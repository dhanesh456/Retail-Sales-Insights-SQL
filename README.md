## üéØ Objective
Analyze retail sales data to uncover **sales trends, customer behavior, and category performance** using **pure SQL**.  
The goal is to transform raw transactional data into **actionable business insights** that can guide decision-making, marketing strategy, and operational efficiency.

## üìñ Overview
This project performs a complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using SQL only.  
It involves database creation, data cleaning, data exploration, and detailed business analysis through structured queries.

Key questions addressed include:
- Which **product categories** generate the highest revenue and sales volume?  
- Who are the **top customers** by spending?  
- Which **months** and **times of day** achieve peak sales?  
- How do **age** and **gender** influence buying patterns?  
- What are the **seasonal trends** and **high-value customer segments**?
